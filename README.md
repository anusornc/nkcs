# NKCS Coevolution

NKCS model for exploring aspects of ([surrogate-assisted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_model)) [coevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_cooperative_coevolution).

The NKCS model is the multi-species version of the [NK model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK_model) where S species coevolve with X other species. Each species is composed of N genes where each gene is affected by K genes within the same species (internal connections) and C genes within each of the coevolving species (external connections).
